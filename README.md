## Description

This repository contains all relevant components for the ARGO application, which was created for my master thesis. Please use the following descriptions to navigate to the desired components.

## Components

### base

This folder contains the base components of the ARGO application, i.e. the source code for all individual applications. It also holds the base Docker Compose file, which can be used to spin up the application easily, in a dev/test scenario.

### swarm

This folder contains the files related to Swarm, which is mainly the general deployment file, describing how the ARGO application should be orchestrated in a Swarm cluster.

### nomad

This folder contains the files related to Nomad, which consist out of configurations for Consul and Nomad, and the Nomad deployment jobs which describe how the ARGO application should be orchestrated in a Nomad cluster. The client and server configurations are examples from our cluster and need to be adjusted in order to function correctly in another environment.

### infra

This folder contains the files related to Ansible, which were used for managing the testing infrastructure. Note that not all necessary configurations were done via Ansible, just some repeatable configurations were captured under IaC.

### pcap

This folder contains the files resulting from different packet captures, used for inspecting encryption mechanism in both Swarm and Nomad. They were captured using `tcpdump` and analyzed with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
